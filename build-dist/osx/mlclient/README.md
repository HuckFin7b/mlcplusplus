# Building a package for Mac OS X

Use this tool:
http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html

And open the packages project in the same folder as this README file.

**NOTE**: You will have to install the latest XCode first in order to
use this installer.

**NOTE**: You will have to build the full project, including samples,
using the gen-eclipse.sh file (NOT the mac or unix files) first.

**NOTE**: Currently this package does NOT install it's dependencies.
