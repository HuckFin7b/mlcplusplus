This repository contains a C++ cross platform wrapper for the MarkLogic Server REST API.

## Introduction



## Quick Start

You can build from source then use in your projects.


### Feature prioritisation

- Basic functionality first, or strong compliance
- MarkLogic version support - V7, V8, earlier?
- Communication data types - XML or JSON for call configuration?
- Depth - just wrapping REST calls? Multiple calls per endpoint? Helper utilities (caching, query/options builders)?
