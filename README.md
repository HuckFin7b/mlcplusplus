This repository contains a C++ cross platform wrapper for the MarkLogic Server REST API.

## Introduction

The MLCPlusPlus project maintains the MarkLogic C++ mlclient API. This API provides a C++ native connection
to MarkLogic Server version 6 and above.

A C wrapper API around the core C++ API is also provided. This enables legacy C applications to be configured to
talk to MarkLogic Server. All C++ usage is abstracted behind this wrapper API.
