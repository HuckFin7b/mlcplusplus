This repository contains a C++ cross platform wrapper for the MarkLogic Server REST API.

## Introduction

The MLCPlusPlus project maintains the MarkLogic C++ mlclient API. This API provides a C++ native connection
to MarkLogic Server version 6 and above.

A C wrapper API around the core C++ API is also provided. This enables legacy C applications to be configured to
talk to MarkLogic Server. All C++ usage is abstracted behind this wrapper API.

## Latest release

The latest release is 8.0.0 - See [The release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamfowleruk/mlcplusplus/develop/documentation/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.md) for details.

Note the Major and Minor version numbers of this project track MarkLogic Server, the revision number tracks this API's changes, rather than the revision number of MarkLogic Server.
