TODO this is a new guide that will be completed as part of 8.0.3.







\section sec_csdev_extensions Using REST extensions or an unsupported endpoint

With the best of intentions it is impossible for us to cover every REST endpoint and REST extension.
We have provided an extension mechanism through these calls:-

- IConnection::doGet - Supports any REST GET
- IConnection::doPost - Post of data
- IConnection::doDelete - Delete
- ICOnnection::doPut - Put

These methods are available on all Connection class instances to execute against any REST endpoint on the
server and port connected to by your Connection class instance.

\subsection sec_csdev_sparqlupdate SPARQL update example

At the time of writing there was not a convenience method wrapping the SPARQL Update endpoint (POST /v1/graphs/sparql).
In order to support this, use code like the following:-


    Connection conn = new Connection();
    TODO connection set up
    GenericTextDocumentContent tdc = new GenericTextDocumentContent();
    tdc.setMimeType("application/sparql-update");
    tdc.setContent("DELETE WHERE { ?s ?p ?o. }‚Äù);
    Response resp = conn.doPost("/v1/graphs/sparql",tdc);

You then process the Response instance as you would for any other Connection function's result.
